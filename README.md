# WDI_Project2 - sparewall

###sparewall is a website which connects people who own spare walls with those who want to paint them. It was made for my second project at GA WDI and was built in 5 days using the following project brief:

* to create a full web application using Sinatra and Ruby
* utilise a MVC design pattern with at least two models
* include an login user authentication system 
* use ActiveRecord as a database ORM

###how it works:
	
* users log in as either a wall owner or an artist and are able to:
		
		* view their profile
		* view walls which are free to paint using either grid view or google maps
		* view completed walls
		* contact a wall-owner/artist via email
		* 

###if i had more time what features would i add:

  * an integrated email or messaging system so that communication between users of sparewall can take place in-house
  * add comments feature whereby users can comment on posts
  * 

###challenges i faced:

##include pics of sketches and wireframes
